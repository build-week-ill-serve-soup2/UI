                <!-- <p class="date">Nov 7th, 2017</p> -->

                <p> I was able to organize a 400 person volunteer line up for a natural disaster. I give the credit to the I'll Serve Soup app. It was a breeze to create a shopping list, organize recipes, and tips for our team to prepare the prep time in
                    advance to assist the disaster in a organized fashion. From small to large charities, I'll Serve Soup is the way to go. -Emily, Des Moine, Iowa
                </p>

                <p>I organize our Church's soup kitchen each and every sunday for the last ten years. Recently, my assistant who handled inventory for food purchase for the last five years had to move. I was left taking over all of her spreadsheets and her
                    personal system, which I wasn't very comfortable with since there were a lot of moving parts between purchasing inventory and organizing the food prep. Luckily, I found I'll Serve soup and which has made my life a breeze. Margaret

                </p>

                <p>Why would I ever go back to using paper trails and spreadsheets now that I have I'll Serve Soup App. I can easily organize my soup kitechen logistics from my phone or tablet! Mark - Boston, Masachusettes </p>
